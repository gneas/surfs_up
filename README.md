# Surfs-Up Surf & Shake Shop
A project intended to examine the viability of a surf and shake shop in Oahu, HI.
## Challenge Overview
An analysis to determine if the temperature data for the months of June and December would prevent the shop from operating year-round.
## Results
Three key observations in the temperature data between June and December were discovered.

- The average (mean) difference between June and December is about 4 degrees.
- The minimum degrees for June and December differ by 8 degrees.
- The maximum degrees for June and December differ only by 2 degrees.
## Summary
From a temperature standpoint, the statistics indicate that June and December are consistent and therefore are unlikely to be an impediment to the business being able to operate year-round. Given this discovery, it would be suggested that additional probing be made. An additional query that may prove useful would be to examine the precipitation frequecy against the precipitation statistics. Also, it would be useful to examine for severe weather events. These two data points may give a more enlightened perspective on how the weather data in June and December may or may not support year-round operations of the Surfs-Up Surf & Shake Shop.
